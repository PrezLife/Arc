		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>Residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are a growing part of the energy mix, but these systems are often poorly designed, deployed, and managed.  They generate a significant amount of data that could be used to help drive improvements, but this data generally is not being used effectively today.</p>
		<h3>The Project Objective</h3>
		<p>A key to improving residential solar system deployments is to enable to installers and homeowners to better visualize and understand how well their systems are performing, and how they can be improved.  Some questions that could be answered with the data that is readily available include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How does actual performance compare to the installers estimates?  What is the cause of any differences?</li>
			<li>What is the best system architecture for any given application?   What utility rate structure should be selected?  What potential benefits could battery storage provide, and how should it be managed?</li>
			<li>Is solar a good or bad investment - environmentally and financially - for this specific residence?</li>
			<li>How much can system performance be improved by relocating panels or obstructions?</li>
			<li>How can consumption be reduced and time-shifted to better match the solar production and utility rate structure?</li>
			<li>What is the impact of this system on the electric grid?   How can the benefits be increased?</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Dataset</h3>
		<p>The primary data source for this project is time-series sample data generated by one or more local solar installations.  The content and format of the data is described in the <a href='https://www.solaredge.com/sites/default/files/se_monitoring_api.pdf'>SolarEdge Cloud Monitoring Server API Documentation</a>.
