		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>Residential photovoltaic (PV) solar systems are a growing part of the energy mix, but these systems are often poorly designed, deployed, and managed.  They generate a significant amount of data that could be used to help drive improvements, but this data generally is not being used effectively today.</p>
		<h3>Project Objective</h3>
		<p>A key to improving residential solar system deployments is to enable to installers and homeowners to better visualize and understand how well their systems are performing and how they can be improved.  Some questions that could be answered with the data that is readily available include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How does actual performance compare to the installer's estimates?  What is the cause of any differences?</li>
			<li>What is the best system architecture for any given application?   What utility rate structure should be selected?  What potential benefits could battery storage provide, and how should the battery be managed?</li>
			<li>Is solar a good or bad investment - environmentally and financially - for this specific residence?</li>
			<li>How much can system performance be improved by relocating panels or obstructions?</li>
			<li>How can consumption be reduced and time-shifted to better match the solar production and utility rate structure?</li>
			<li>What is the impact of this system on the electric grid?  How can its benefits be increased?</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Dataset</h3>
		<p>The primary data source for this project is time-series sample data generated by one or more local solar installations.  I have developed a server application that cleans, synchronizes, and transforms the raw data to make it more useful.   The content, format, and location of the processed data is described here:  <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/13JaAGiKa_JF0E74BHfIRBKhbvzQTzvSR/view?usp=drivesdk'>SPA Data Flow</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>Additional Information</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I have developed a simple web app for my own use in exploring, visualizing, and experimenting with the data.  Currently, its content is very rough and not suitable for general public use.  I plan on continuing to refine it over the coming weeks and months:  <a href='https://solarperf.s3.amazonaws.com/index2.html'>Solar Performance Analysis</a></li>
			<li>Information on the SolarEdge monitoring platform that consumers and installers currently have access to if they install a solar system that includes a SolarEdge inverter:  <a href="https://www.solaredge.com/us/products/pv-monitoring#/">The SolarEdge monitoring platform</a></li>
